# MFrontGallery

This project aims at gathering high quality, thoroughly tested, well
written, efficient and **ready-to-use** `MFront` implementations of
various material properties, behaviours and models.

It is mainly decomposed in two parts:

- `generic-behaviours`: this part is dedicated to various mechanical
  behaviours that can be adapted to describe many materials. Those
  behaviours are sorted by category:
    - `hyperelasticity`
    - `hyperviscoelasticity`
    - `damage`
    - `plasticity`
    - `viscoelasticity`
    - `viscoplasticity`
- `materials`: this part gathers to specific materials.

The last purpose of this project is to show how to build a compilation
project for `MFront`'s properties, behaviours and models.
