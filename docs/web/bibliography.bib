	abstract = {It is shown that for problems involving rate constitutive equations, such as rate-independent elastoplasticity, the notion of consistency between the tangent (stiffness) operator and the integration algorithm employed in the solution of the incremental problem, plays a crucial role in preserving the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence of iterative solution schemes based upon Newton's method. Within the framework of closest-point-projection algorithms, a methodology is presented whereby tangent operators consistent with this class of algorithms may be systematically developed. To wit, associative J2 flow rules with general nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening rules, as well as a class of non-associative flow rules are considered. The resulting iterative solution scheme preserves the asymptotic quadratic convergence characteristic of Newton's method, whereas use of the socalled elastoplastic tangent in conjunction with a radial return integration algorithm, a procedure often employed, results in Newton type of algorithms with suboptimal rate of convergence. Application is made to a set of numerical examples which include saturation hardening laws of exponential type.},

abstract = {The present work discusses a finite-strain plasticity model for soft clays. To motivate such a model, the infinitesimal-strain assumption is shown to be inadequate for the constitutive description of soft clays. Hence, assuming the multiplicative elasto-plastic decomposition of the deformation gradient, a finite-strain Cam-clay model is presented. In particular, with respect to the original Cam-clay formulation, this model improves the description of the isotropic compression behaviour as well as of the elastic shearing response. The constitutive laws are discussed and their implications are pointed out. The physical meaning of the model parameters is carefully addressed. Finally, the ability to properly match some experimental results available in the literature is assessed. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The integration rules fall under the category of return mapping algorithms in which the return directions are computed by closest point projection for associative flow rule and by central return mapping for non-associative flow rule applied to the Cam-Clay ellipsoids. Stress updates take place at the Gauss points upon enforcement of the consistency condition in which the appropriate consistency parameters are determined iteratively on the scalar level. Numerical examples with geotechnical applications, which include an analysis of foundation bearing capacity and an investigation of deformations in vertical cuts, are discussed to demonstrate the global accuracy and stability of the numerical solution.

abstract = {The infinitesimal version of the modified Cam-Clay model of critical state soil mechanics is reformulated to include finite deformation effects. Central to the formulation are the choice of a hardening law that is appropriate for cases involving large plastic volumetric strains, and the use of a class of two-invariant stored energy functions appropriate for Cam-Clay-type models that includes, as special cases, the constant elastic shear modulus approximation as well as the pressure-dependent shear modulus elastic model. The analytical model is cast within the framework of finite deformation theory based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. For the fully elasto-plastic case, return mapping is done implicitly in the space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches, which requires the solution at each stress point of no more than three simultaneous non-linear equations. A finite element analysis of a strip footing problem is presented to illustrate a prototype example where finite deformation effects significantly impact the predicted response. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

The models are extensions of a recent work and considers pressure dependent behavior for porous SMAs as well as the coupling effects of transformation and plasticity for both dense and porous SMAs. In contrast to dense SMAs, a considerable plastic strain accumulates in porous SMAs even during phase transformation. Therefore, an effective solution algorithm for simultaneous evolution of transformation and plastic strain is presented via replacement of the classical Kuhn-Tucker inequality conditions by the so-called Fischer-Burmeister complementarity function. Numerical predictions are compared with experimental results and a comprehensive study is performed on the material parameters regarding coupling effects and pressure dependency. Moreover, we implement the model using corotational formulation and perform finite element analysis of a porous SMA spring actuator, and a tube under non-proportional loading to assess the reliability of the proposed model for large rotations and general multiaxial loadings.},

The framework is based on the modelling and parametrisation of the material's microstructure via laminates together with the respective volume fractions. These volume fractions are treated as internal-state variables and are subject to several inequality constraints which can be treated in terms of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The Fischer–Burmeister NCP function provides a sophisticated scheme to incorporate Karush–Kuhn–Tucker-type conditions into calculations of internal-state variables. However, these functions are prone to numerical instabilities in their original form.

@article{Helfer2015,
abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between {\'{E}}lectricit{\'{e}} de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES's main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++ (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code-Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

The solutions are presented for a specific volume, and volumetric and generalized shear strains. In the case of a proportional loading only straight effective stress paths are considered while in the case of a circular loading the maximum possible change in Lode's angle is $\pi$/3 due to plastic isotropy. Additionally, a concept of deviatoric stiffness is devised and an analytical expression for the generalized hardening modulus is derived. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are carried out in the form of direct comparisons between analytical solutions for drained and undrained loading histories thus offering an improved understanding of the three-invariant model.

abstract = {Continuum numerical modeling of dynamic crack propagation has been a great challenge over the past decade. This is particularly the case for anticracks in porous materials, as reported in sedimentary rocks, deep earthquakes, landslides, and snow avalanches, as material inter-penetration further complicates the problem. Here, on the basis of a new elastoplasticity model for porous cohesive materials and a large strain hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian numerical method, we accurately reproduced the onset and propagation dynamics of anticracks observed in snow fracture experiments. The key ingredient consists of a modified strain-softening plastic flow rule that captures the complexity of porous materials under mixed-mode loading accounting for the interplay between cohesion loss and volumetric collapse. Our unified model represents a significant step forward as it simulates solid-fluid phase transitions in geomaterials which is of paramount importance to mitigate and forecast gravitational hazards.},

	abstract = {The prediction of large concrete structures behavior such as bridges, dams and Nuclear Containment Buildings ({NCB}) is a key issue with regards to the evaluation of their durability, safety and the safety of their surrounding environment. In this work, a weakly coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical ({THM}) modeling strategy is presented within the serviceability state of large structures. It aims at (a) defining and predicting the temperature, the relative humidity, the strains and the stresses in ageing concrete structures under variable and realistic {THM} loads and (b) qualitatively assessing the damage risk using a stress-based criterion. With that aim in view, the effect of concrete drying on its long term behavior is highlighted by using a revisited description of drying creep adapted to variable hydric conditions. The concrete’s response to variable {THM} boundaries is also compared to the one where mean and constant ones are considered in the case of {NCBs}. Two concrete types and three scales are considered for the {THM} study: the specimen scale for concrete properties identification, the 1:3 and 1:1 (full) scales of Representative Structural Volumes ({RSV}) for predictive and structural analyses. Through the {FE} sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the spatial variation of the temperature along the {NCB}’s height has more effect on the concrete’s ageing than its variation in time. Whereas, the temporal variation of hydric boundaries has a negligible effect away from the drying-exposed surfaces. Finally, it is demonstrated that, due to initial prestressing loads, the ageing kinetic within the {NCB}’s wall is heterogeneous and cannot be described using constant prestressing loads. Therefore, it is recommended to account for the spatial {THM} boundaries’ variation when predicting the global concrete ageing in large concrete structures.},

	abstract = {Electricité de France ({EDF}) operates a large fleet of nuclear reactors and is responsible for demonstrating the safety of facilities, including concrete containment buildings ({CCB}), which are non-replaceable components. The leak-tightness of {CCBs} is assessed every 10 years during integrated leak-rate tests ({IRLT}). For double-wall containments, which have no metallic liners, the leak-tightness is strongly influenced by the degree of cracking of concrete and opening of the cracks, which mostly depends on (a) the prestress decrease due to the delayed strains of concrete and to a lesser extent due to relaxation of tendons steel, and (b) the saturation degree of the Powered by Editorial Manager® and {ProduXion} Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation concrete wall. Therefore, to optimize the maintenance programs on {CCBs}, it is important to predict the evolution of drying, creep and shrinkage strains of concrete to be able to correctly assess the pre-stress losses, and finally the air leak-tightness at a structural level during pressure tests or under accidental loadings. To improve our understanding and identify the best modelling practices on this issue, a large experimental program called {VERCORS} was launched in 2014. {VERCORS} is a 1/3 mock-up of a 1300 {MWe} nuclear reactor {CCB}. It has been widely instrumented, and its concrete thoroughly characterized. A specific attention has been paid to ensure it is consistent with real {CBBs} features in {EDF}'s nuclear fleet. To complement its internal R\&D efforts, {EDF} decided to associate external partners to this program. One of the means for this is the organization of benchmarks, where all teams are given data and information about the mock-up and are asked to quantitatively predict its behaviour. The present paper reports the organization and findings of the 2nd benchmark which was organized in 2018 and gathered several international teams around the same objective: improve the confidence in the modelling of structural behaviour as well as the leak-tightness of concrete in containment walls under pressure test loading. The benchmark has shown once again that predicting the mechanical and leakage behaviour of containment buildings is a difficult task. The benchmark also yielded interesting information about the possibility to use spatially reduced models to predict the mechanical behaviour and leakage and underlined the fact that more research must be done to better predict the localization of cracks and leakage. Some lessons have been learnt for the next benchmark: {EDF} will ask to clarify further the calibration methods, will give more data (including drying, creep and shrinkage at different temperatures and moisture measurements in the mock-up), and will help the participants using local leakage data by projecting the raw measurements on a regular grid, so that the local leakage models can be improved.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACT A three-dimensional rheological modelling is proposed for the long term concrete mechanical behaviour. Concrete is supposed to have a non-linear visco-elastic behaviour. The non-linearity used first allows conferring a realistic non asymptotic strain to the basic creep, based on a consolidation theory. Moreover, for the non-saturated concrete, a dependence of the capillary pressure effects on the stress state is postulated. It assumed that a damage state exists around microcavities in depression, this damage depends also on the applied stresses whose can led to a closing or opening of the micro-cracking and consequently to a best or to a worst transmission of capillary effects to the solid skeleton. This dependency is highlighted using a simple numerical analysis of a composite material including in an elastic matrix both cavities in depression and rigid inclusions. The linear dependence of capillary effect on the applied stress confers to the model the capability to simulate shrinkage and drying creep strains. }

abstract={The previously formulated rate-type aging creep law based on Maxwell chain is generalized to variable humidity and is calibrated by extensive comparisons with test data from the literature. The main object of attention is the Pickett effect, i.e., the apparent increase in creep due to drying simultaneous with loading. This effect is shown to have four sources, in their decreasing order of importance: (1) stress-induced shrinkage, (2) tensile strain softening due to progressive cracking, (3) irreversibility of unloading contraction after tensile strainsoftening, and (4) increase of material stiffness due to aging (hydration). The model, which is a special case of a previously advanced thermodynamic theory, depends on only one hypothesis about the microscopic physical mechanism of creep: The creep rate depends on the magnitude of the flux of microdiffusion of water between the macropores (capillary pores) and the micropores in the cement gel. By assuming this microdiffusion to be infinitely fast, the effect is reduced to a dependence of creep viscosities on the time rate of pore humidity, and this is further shown to be equivalent to stress-induced shrinkage, in which the shrinkage coefficient defining the ratio of the increments of shrinkage strain and pore relative humidity depends on stress. In three dimensions, the shrinkage coefficient thus becomes a tensor. For thermodynamic reasons, there must also exist stress-induced thermal expansion. Although tensile cracking is found to make significant contribution to the Pickett effect, it is far from sufficient to explain in fully. The theory agrees with test data on basic creep, creep of specimens with reduced water content at hygral equilibrium (predried), shrinkage, swelling, and creep at drying under compression, tension, or bending. The strainsoftening model used for tensile cracking is the same as that used previously to fit test data from fracture tests, direct tensile tests, and deflection tests of reinforced beams.},

The Fischer-Burmeister function is used to map the optimality conditions of a quadratic program to a nonlinear system of equations which is solved using Newton's method. Regularization and smoothing are applied to improve the practical performance of the algorithm and a merit function is used to globalize convergence. {FBRS} is simple to code, easy to warmstart, robust to early termination, and has attractive theoretical properties, making it appealing for real time and embedded applications. Numerical experiments using several predictive control examples show that the proposed method is competitive with other state-of-the-art solvers.},
